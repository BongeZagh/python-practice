./request_image.py this version is for graping pic id from the linkk

./sln-1.1.py this version is trying to solve multi pic-id per line, and how to name the image file, because i think it might override the file.

./sln.py this is the original selenium download image program

./urls.csv this is for ./request_image.py to read, store the pic id data

./2010picid.csv  cp ./urls.csv to this file type for ./sln.py to read
