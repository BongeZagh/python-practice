            "[00:24.000 --> 00:33.000]  Perfect double tops and bottoms, they're rare. Triple tops that are perfect, triple bottoms that are perfect are even more rare.\n",
            "[00:33.000 --> 00:40.000]  But close is close enough. Most double tops and double bottoms are parts of major trend reversals.\n",
            "[00:40.000 --> 00:52.000]  In fact, all major trend reversals are a type of double top or double bottom where the second top or second bottom is not exactly at the same level as the first.\n",
            "[00:52.000 --> 01:02.000]  Bottom line, the market is trying to reverse whether or not the pattern is a perfect double top or a perfect double bottom.\n",
            "[01:02.000 --> 01:13.000]  Again, all major trend reversals can be thought of as double tops and bottoms. You can look at the module on major trend reversals.\n",
            "[01:13.000 --> 01:20.000]  It does not matter that the two tops in a double top reversal are not identical.\n",
            "[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  Sometimes the second high is a little higher and you can call it a higher high or a double top. It doesn't matter.\n",
            "[01:26.000 --> 01:31.000]  If it's a little lower, you can call it a lower high or a double top. Again, it doesn't matter.\n",
            "[01:31.000 --> 01:40.000]  The idea is the same. The market is making two attempts to go up. It doesn't matter whether the second attempt is above or at or below the first attempt.\n",
            "[01:40.000 --> 01:44.000]  The process is the same.\n",
            "[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  The same with the double bottom reversal. Usually the two bottoms are not identical.\n",
            "[01:49.000 --> 02:00.000]  The second low can be a little bit below the first. It can be a little bit above the first, a higher low. It can be perfect. It doesn't really matter.\n",
            "[02:00.000 --> 02:10.000]  Here's an example of a double bottom. It's not a high probability setup because we have a pretty tight bare microchannel.\n",
            "[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  We have a pullback here, but I would still call this a microchannel.\n",
            "[02:15.000 --> 02:22.000]  A possible one bar final flag here and then a final flag failure, but the signal bar is not all that good.\n",
            "[02:22.000 --> 02:30.000]  A lot of major trend reversals have low probability, and this is an example of a low probability setup.\n",
            "[02:30.000 --> 02:37.000]  Initial target, if you do take it, would be two times your risk. Your entry price is one tick above that bar.\n",
            "[02:37.000 --> 02:41.000]  Your stop is one tick below and two times your risk is right here.\n",
            "[02:41.000 --> 02:49.000]  You can see a pullback developed here, so a lot of traders were taking profits at around two times their initial risk.\n",
            "[02:49.000 --> 02:59.000]  That should always be your minimum goal when you're doing a low probability trade.\n",
            "[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  Double tops and bottoms. They're much more common as flags, as pullbacks than they are as reversals.\n",
            "[03:05.000 --> 03:15.000]  For example, a double top bare flag is common and a bare trend. A double top bull flag is a common pattern and a bull trend.\n",
            "[03:15.000 --> 03:27.000]  Flags are rarely perfect, but don't lose sight of the goal. You're looking to enter at the end of the pullback.\n",
            "[03:27.000 --> 03:36.000]  Sometimes when you have a double top bare flag, the second high is a lot higher or a lot lower than the first.\n",
            "[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  It doesn't matter. They're still low to sell setups. You have a push up and a second push up.\n",
            "[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  The second push sometimes is much higher than the first. It's two legs up. You can call it an ABC.\n",
            "[03:47.000 --> 03:55.000]  You can call it a low to sell setup and a bear trend. It's functionally the same as a double top, and you trade them the same, whether or not they're perfect.\n",
            "[03:58.000 --> 04:08.000]  Double bottom bull flag. So if you have a bull trend and a pullback and then a rally and then another pullback, sometimes the second pullback is much lower than the first.\n",
            "[04:08.000 --> 04:19.000]  It can be much higher than the first. In either case, it's still a high to buy setup. All double bottoms are high to buy setups, and the process is the same.\n",
            "[04:19.000 --> 04:24.000]  The market made two attempts to reverse. It failed, and the trend resumed.\n",
            "[04:27.000 --> 04:34.000]  Here we have a bull trend, and we have a double bottom. The second low is a little bit below the first, but you have a double bottom and a bull trend.\n",
            "[04:34.000 --> 04:43.000]  It's a high to buy. It has a bull signal bar with a close above the moving average. That makes it a more reliable buy, a higher probability buy.\n",
            "[04:43.000 --> 04:56.000]  Here you have a double bottom with the second low a lot lower than the first. At this point, it's in a trading range, and it doesn't matter that the second is lower than the first.\n",
            "[04:56.000 --> 05:07.000]  Any double bottom is a high to buy, especially on the open. You're looking for reversals up near support. We're near the bottom of yesterday.\n",
            "[05:07.000 --> 05:14.000]  We're near yesterday's low, so that's the support level. We have a high to at the bottom of a trading range. It's a reasonable buy.\n",
            "[05:14.000 --> 05:22.000]  Then we have a bull microchannel with four bull bars, two of them very big. It's a high one buy. You can buy above that bar.\n",
            "[05:22.000 --> 05:33.000]  Over here, we have two legs down. We have two smaller legs down here. This buy, I probably would not take it because the bull bar is small compared to these two bear bars.\n",
            "[05:33.000 --> 05:44.000]  I would wait for a second entry. We have a larger two-legged pattern, one and two. This is a high two, referring to this first push down and here the second.\n",
            "[05:44.000 --> 05:52.000]  A two-bar reversal. A second bar bull bar, so a pretty good buy signal, despite the six-bar, seven-bar bear microchannel.\n",
            "[05:52.000 --> 05:59.000]  It's also a double bottom with this bar, so you can call it a double bottom with this number one or a double bottom with this number one.\n",
            "[05:59.000 --> 06:06.000]  Either case, any kind of a double bottom is a high two buy setup. So that's a buy setup.\n",
            "[06:06.000 --> 06:12.000]  We have a higher high major trend reversal and then a lower high major trend reversal and then a bear breakout.\n",
            "[06:12.000 --> 06:21.000]  A little pullback and then a sell off and then a second little pullback. Again, not exactly at the same level as the first, but it's a double top.\n",
            "[06:21.000 --> 06:27.000]  A double top is a low two and a bear trend. So this is, you can call it a double top. You can call it a low two.\n",
            "[06:27.000 --> 06:35.000]  If you want, you can simply call it a low one. You can say it's the first pullback in a bear microchannel that has gone down for about eight bars.\n",
            "[06:35.000 --> 06:41.000]  All of those are good reasons to short. Here, the market went down on bar one and then up on bar one.\n",
            "[06:41.000 --> 06:49.000]  And then it went down here and then up again here. So it's a double top. So this is a double top. It's a low two short.\n",
            "[06:49.000 --> 06:59.000]  However, it's occurring late in a trend and the trend has a series of consecutive sell climaxes here and then here and then here and then here and then here and then here.\n",
            "[06:59.000 --> 07:08.000]  So this is a potential final flag and it turned out to be the final flag in the bear trend leading to a reversal.\n",
            "[07:08.000 --> 07:18.000]  Double tops and bottoms flags, double top bear flag, a double bottom bull flag. They're often parts of major trend reversals.\n",
            "[07:18.000 --> 07:24.000]  A lower high major trend reversal often has a small double top forming the lower high.\n",
            "[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  So in other words, the lower high can have two little pushes up in it.\n",
            "[07:28.000 --> 07:38.000]  When you have a double bottom bull flag after a potential bottom, that little higher low can have two pushes down and form a double bottom bull flag for the higher low major trend reversal.\n",
            "[07:38.000 --> 07:46.000]  So for example, we have a bull trend, a trend line break, higher high major trend reversal below this bar.\n",
            "[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  Second entry, here's the first.\n",
            "[07:48.000 --> 07:58.000]  And then we have this small double top. So we have a higher high major trend reversal and now we have a lower high and the lower high is in the form of a double top.\n",
            "[07:58.000 --> 08:01.000]  And that's a common pattern in major trend reversals.\n",
            "[08:01.000 --> 08:07.000]  It looks pretty innocuous and doesn't look like a possible reversal.\n",
            "[08:07.000 --> 08:11.000]  But when you're aware of the context, it's a possible reversal.\n",
            "[08:11.000 --> 08:17.000]  Here we have a bear trend, a strong breakout above the trend line and above the moving average.\n",
            "[08:17.000 --> 08:20.000]  And we have a higher low major trend reversal.\n",
            "[08:20.000 --> 08:23.000]  And then the market went sideways and formed a small double bottom.\n",
            "[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  So we have a double bottom bull flag.\n",
            "[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  And this is the bull flag.\n",
            "[08:28.000 --> 08:31.000]  And then we have a higher low major trend reversal.\n",
            "[08:31.000 --> 08:34.000]  And then we have a higher low major trend reversal.\n",
            "[08:34.000 --> 08:37.000]  And then the market went sideways and formed a small double bottom.\n",
            "[08:37.000 --> 08:39.000]  So we have a double bottom bull flag.\n",
            "[08:39.000 --> 08:43.000]  And this is a higher low major trend reversal.\n",
            "[08:43.000 --> 08:48.000]  We have a low and now we have a higher low and the higher low came in the form of a double bottom.\n",
            "[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  You can either buy here or you can buy here.\n",
            "[08:55.000 --> 08:56.000]  Here's the double top.\n",
            "[08:56.000 --> 08:58.000]  Again, not perfect, right?\n",
            "[08:58.000 --> 09:01.000]  A lot of double tops are not perfect.\n",
            "[09:01.000 --> 09:02.000]  Potential small final flag.\n",
            "[09:02.000 --> 09:03.000]  Three pushes up.\n",
            "[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  One, two, three.\n",
            "[09:05.000 --> 09:06.000]  A high two.\n",
            "[09:06.000 --> 09:11.000]  A high two occurring late in a bull trend often is the final flag of the bull trend.\n",
            "[09:11.000 --> 09:15.000]  It's a high two because we have a push down here and then we have a second push down here.\n",
            "[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  It does not matter that this bar did not go above the high of that bar.\n",
            "[09:19.000 --> 09:21.000]  It's a two-legged correction.\n",
            "[09:21.000 --> 09:22.000]  One, two.\n",
            "[09:22.000 --> 09:23.000]  Also, it's a double bottom.\n",
            "[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  And every double bottom is a high two.\n",
            "[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  So this is a high two bull flag occurring late in a bull trend.\n",
            "[09:29.000 --> 09:34.000]  And therefore a possible final flag.\n",
            "[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  It could be the last flag in the bull trend before there's a big reversal.\n",
            "[09:37.000 --> 09:42.000]  We broke out to the upside and the next bar we have a failure.\n",
            "[09:42.000 --> 09:43.000]  A bear inside bar.\n",
            "[09:43.000 --> 09:48.000]  So this is a failed bull breakout and a reasonably good signal bar.\n",
            "[09:48.000 --> 09:57.000]  And then we had this huge bear reversal bar that reversed not only the trend, it reversed the lows of all of these bars.\n",
            "[09:57.000 --> 10:04.000]  So everyone who bought from this bar onward is now holding a losing position once this bar closed.\n",
            "[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  So this bar reversed all of these closes.\n",
            "[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  It closed below all of these closes.\n",
            "[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  And it reversed all of these lows.\n",
            "[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  So that is an extremely strong bear reversal bar.\n",
            "[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  And it probably will result in a measured move down at a minimum based on the height of the body.\n",
            "[10:19.000 --> 10:25.000]  So from the open of the bar to the close of the bar, chances are we'll get at least a measured move down.\n",
            "[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  So this bear spike probably flipped the market to always in short in the minds of traders.\n",
            "[10:31.000 --> 10:37.000]  And it probably will have a lot of follow through.\n",
            "[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  You could argue, okay, here's my, you could argue that we have a bear signal bar.\n",
            "[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  So you sell one tick below and you put a stop one tick above.\n",
            "[10:47.000 --> 10:51.000]  And your first target could be two times your initial risk.\n",
            "[10:51.000 --> 10:54.000]  So that's your initial risk from your entry price to your stop.\n",
            "[10:54.000 --> 10:57.000]  This red line is two times that risk.\n",
            "[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  And you can see a lot of traders took profits here.\n",
            "[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  That's what caused this rally up to the moving average.\n",
            "[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  And the rally immediately failed and became a bear bar.\n",
            "[11:08.000 --> 11:10.000]  So you have a strong bear breakout.\n",
            "[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  And the next bar is a bear bar.\n",
            "[11:12.000 --> 11:20.000]  That confirms the breakout and it increases the chances that there'll be lower prices.\n",
            "[11:20.000 --> 11:22.000]  We're going sideways here.\n",
            "[11:22.000 --> 11:26.000]  And we might be double bottoming with this earlier low.\n",
            "[11:26.000 --> 11:31.000]  And to me, I would be cautious in here.\n",
            "[11:31.000 --> 11:39.000]  You know, you took half off at two times your initial risk with this huge tail up around the neighborhood of support.\n",
            "[11:39.000 --> 11:42.000]  This is a potential double bottom.\n",
            "[11:42.000 --> 11:48.000]  I probably would get out of the entire position here and look to short again on a second signal.\n",
            "[11:48.000 --> 11:54.000]  As far as buying this for the large double bottom, I probably would wait.\n",
            "[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  But it's possible that the trend will resume.\n",
            "[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  And that's, in fact, what it did.\n",
            "[11:59.000 --> 12:02.000]  However, what took place up here?\n",
            "[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  A test of the prior high.\n",
            "[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  So a potential double top.\n",
            "[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  All right.\n",
            "[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  But look, what else happened?\n",
            "[12:10.000 --> 12:17.000]  We have a bull trend, a break below the trend line, a very strong break below the trend line and a break below the moving average.\n",
            "[12:17.000 --> 12:22.000]  So you have to suspect that there might be a lot of sellers at the new high.\n",
            "[12:22.000 --> 12:23.000]  Right.\n",
            "[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  So it's a higher high major trend reversal.\n",
            "[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  Not only that, look what happened here.\n",
            "[12:27.000 --> 12:31.000]  We have a high, a higher high and a higher high.\n",
            "[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  We have a low and a lower low.\n",
            "[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  So three pushes up.\n",
            "[12:35.000 --> 12:37.000]  This is an expanding triangle.\n",
            "[12:37.000 --> 12:45.000]  And every expanding triangle top is a major trend reversal and usually a reasonable short.\n",
            "[12:45.000 --> 12:54.000]  A weak signal bar, but the context is good for a short, an expanding triangle following very strong selling pressure.\n",
            "[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  This is a problem for the bears.\n",
            "[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  All right.\n",
            "[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  Their initial stop was above the high of the signal bar.\n",
            "[13:03.000 --> 13:09.000]  After this strong bear bar, most bears would put their stop one tick above its high.\n",
            "[13:09.000 --> 13:13.000]  So their actual risk was from their entry one tick below the signal bar.\n",
            "[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  And it was one tick above the high.\n",
            "[13:16.000 --> 13:24.000]  If that's all they had to risk to stay in the position, a lot of traders would change their profit target to two times their actual risk.\n",
            "[13:24.000 --> 13:32.000]  Instead of two times their initial risk above the signal bar, they would lower their or they would reduce their profit expectations.\n",
            "[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  And that's exactly what took place here.\n",
            "[13:34.000 --> 13:39.000]  We went just a little bit below two times the actual risk.\n",
            "[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  And now it found a lot of buyers.\n",
            "[13:41.000 --> 13:48.000]  So you had bears buying back their shorts and you probably had a lot of bulls buying as well.\n",
            "[13:48.000 --> 13:51.000]  So at this point, I think the picture is unclear.\n",
            "[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  This could be a pullback from the breakout above this high.\n",
            "[13:54.000 --> 14:00.000]  It could be a pullback from this bear breakout below this leg up.\n",
            "[14:00.000 --> 14:01.000]  Don't know yet.\n",
            "[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  So it's a confusing picture.\n",
            "[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  Probably a trading range.\n",
            "[14:05.000 --> 14:08.000]  Still an okay swing short with a stop above that bar.\n",
            "[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  You took half off over here.\n",
            "[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  If it gets above that high, you'll still end up with a profitable trade.\n",
            "[14:15.000 --> 14:20.000]  The bulls, they'll buy this as a breakout pullback buy, hoping for an upside breakout.\n",
            "[14:20.000 --> 14:25.000]  And they'll want to go for a risk, a reward equal to twice their risk.\n",
            "[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  The risk is below the signal bar.\n",
            "[14:27.000 --> 14:28.000]  Their entry price is here.\n",
            "[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  So the risk is from here to here.\n",
            "[14:31.000 --> 14:41.000]  And since it's a low probability trade, they need twice their risk to be an adequate profit to offset the low probability of buying at the top of a trading range.\n",
            "[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  So if you take this buy, you have to go for a reward twice your risk.\n",
            "[14:45.000 --> 14:52.000]  To me, I think it's still on this major trend reversal short with a stop above the high of that strong bear bar.\n",
            "[14:55.000 --> 14:57.000]  Now the trend is resuming down.\n",
            "[14:57.000 --> 15:02.000]  You could short below this bear bar as a pullback from the initial bear breakout.\n",
            "[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  And it looks like we're probably in a bear trend.\n",

            "[16:33.000 --> 16:42.000]  But once the trend resumed back down, you knew that if you had to stop one tick above that price, the high of this bar, you would not have been stopped out.\n",
            "[16:42.000 --> 16:44.000]  Your entry price is here.\n",

            "[16:46.000 --> 16:48.000]  Two times your actual risk was here.\n",
            "[16:48.000 --> 16:51.000]  A good location to take partial profits.\n",

            "[17:11.000 --> 17:15.000]  So it's still reasonable to treat this as a bear trend.\n",
            "[17:15.000 --> 17:20.000]  We have a trading range, a strong bear breakout, and a two-legged pullback.\n",
            "[17:20.000 --> 17:24.000]  So you could short this below this bear bar.\n",
            "[17:24.000 --> 17:29.000]  You would have been filled right here looking for more down.\n",
            "[17:29.000 --> 17:33.000]  Initial stop above the high of the signal bar.\n",
            "[17:33.000 --> 17:36.000]  And your initial target would be two times your initial risk.\n",
            "[17:36.000 --> 17:41.000]  Once we started down, traders would tighten their stop to just above the high of this bear bar.\n",
            "[17:41.000 --> 17:46.000]  And their actual risk would be from their entry price right here to right here.\n",

            "[17:53.000 --> 17:54.000]  Okay.\n",
            "[17:54.000 --> 17:57.000]  This leg down is mostly within a channel.\n",
            "[17:57.000 --> 18:03.000]  And it's possible that it's only the first leg of a much larger two-legged pattern.\n",
            "[18:03.000 --> 18:09.000]  This is the weekly chart of the SPDR ETF.\n",
            "[18:11.000 --> 18:18.000]  This shows what took place after that lower high short over here.\n",
            "[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  We had a very strong sell-off.\n",
            "[18:20.000 --> 18:23.000]  Again, this is the weekly SPDR, the SPY.\n",
            "[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  And we had a low to short.\n",
            "[18:26.000 --> 18:33.000]  So a potential final flag whenever you have a low to short occurring late in a bear trend.\n",
            "[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  It's often the final flag, especially after a sell climax.\n",
            "[18:37.000 --> 18:39.000]  And then we have another sell climax.\n",
            "[18:39.000 --> 18:40.000]  Not a very good buy.\n",
            "[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  It's forcing traders to buy too high up in a potential trading range.\n",
            "[18:44.000 --> 18:47.000]  There's another low to short here with a decent bear bar.\n",
            "[18:47.000 --> 18:48.000]  So a reasonable short.\n",
            "[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  A pullback from this bear breakout.\n",
            "[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  So we've got a pullback here from this bear breakout.\n",
            "[18:52.000 --> 18:54.000]  So now we've got three pushes up.\n",
            "[18:54.000 --> 18:55.000]  One, two, three.\n",
            "[18:55.000 --> 18:57.000]  You can treat this as a triangle.\n",
            "[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  And it's a short here as well.\n",
            "[18:59.000 --> 19:02.000]  And then we have another bear breakout.\n",
            "[19:02.000 --> 19:08.000]  At this point, we have a bear trend line, a break above the bear trend line.\n",
            "[19:08.000 --> 19:14.000]  It did not quite reach the moving average, but it's sideways for about 10 or 15 bars.\n",
            "[19:14.000 --> 19:18.000]  We're starting to accumulate a lot of buying pressure.\n",
            "[19:18.000 --> 19:22.000]  So this whole pattern might end up being the final flag of the bear trend.\n",
            "[19:22.000 --> 19:26.000]  We have a final sell climax and a two-bar reversal.\n",
            "[19:26.000 --> 19:29.000]  You can say this is the first bar down.\n",
            "[19:29.000 --> 19:35.000]  Or you can say these two bars are the first push down, and this is the reversal up.\n",
            "[19:35.000 --> 19:41.000]  To me, this is a potential final flag reversal and a reasonable buy above the high of this bar.\n",
            "[19:41.000 --> 19:46.000]  A minimum target would be a pullback back into this final flag.\n",
            "[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  We'll probably get at least 10 bars and two legs sideways to up.\n",
            "[19:50.000 --> 19:55.000]  And as you know, this was the low of the bear trend.\n",
